Configure notifications for low wallet balances so you never run out of funds unexpectedly.

## Alert channels

| Channel     | Setup                                                                         |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Email**   | Add one or more email addresses — alerts are sent when a threshold is crossed |
| **Webhook** | Add a webhook URL — Pollar sends a `sponsor.balance.low` event                |

## Per-wallet thresholds

Set independent thresholds for each operator wallet:

| Wallet              | Suggested threshold                  |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Funding wallet      | 20 XLM                               |
| Gas wallet          | 5 XLM                                |
| Distribution wallet | Depends on asset and expected volume |

When a wallet drops below its threshold, Pollar sends an alert immediately and repeats every 24 hours until the wallet is topped up.
