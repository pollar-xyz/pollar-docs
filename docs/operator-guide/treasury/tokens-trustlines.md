Configure which assets are automatically enabled on new user wallets at creation or activation.

## How it works

When a user wallet is created or activated, Pollar automatically sets up a trustline for each asset configured here. Users never need to manually enable assets.

Each trustline adds **0.5 XLM** to the wallet's reserve cost — charged from your funding wallet. See [App Wallets](https://docs.pollar.xyz/docs/operator-guide/treasury/account-funding) for the full cost breakdown.

## Adding an asset

1. Click **Add asset**
2. Enter the asset code (e.g. `USDC`) and issuer G-address
3. Click **Save**

The asset is enabled on all new wallets from this point. Existing wallets are not affected.

Always verify issuer addresses from the official asset issuer before adding.

## Removing an asset

Removing an asset from the list stops it from being added to new wallets. Existing trustlines on active wallets are not removed — trustlines can only be removed by the wallet owner.
