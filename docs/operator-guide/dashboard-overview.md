title: "Dashboard Overview"
---

The Pollar Dashboard at [dashboard.pollar.xyz](https://dashboard.pollar.xyz) is the control panel for your app's configuration. Sign in with Google — no Stellar wallet required.

Each app you create is isolated with its own API keys, wallets, and configuration. You can switch between apps from the top navigation bar.

## Navigation

The per-app sidebar is organized into seven groups. A few sections are still gated behind a "coming soon" state — marked `upcoming` below.

### Overview

## Get started checklist

When you create a new app, the Dashboard shows a checklist of required steps before you can go live:

1. **Configure API keys** — generate a publishable key to connect your SDK
2. **Configure domains** — add allowed origins so the SDK can make requests
3. **App wallet created and funded** — your funding wallet must be active on Stellar with enough XLM to cover wallet creation
4. **Enable trustlines** — configure at least one asset so user wallets can hold it
5. **Install the SDK and create your first wallet** — confirms the integration is working end-to-end

## Testnet vs Mainnet

Each app targets a single network. Apps start on **Testnet**; moving to **Mainnet** is a gated request/approval flow (via the network control in the top bar), not a free toggle. API keys, wallets, and configuration are scoped to the app's network.

Start on Testnet — it's free and resets periodically. Request Mainnet when you're ready for production. See [Mainnet Checklist](https://docs.pollar.xyz/docs/guides/mainnet-checklist) before switching.
