title: "Webhooks"
---

Pollar uses webhooks in two directions:

- **Inbound** — your backend receives a call from Pollar when an event occurs

- **Outbound** — your backend calls Pollar to trigger an action (e.g. `POST /v1/wallets/activate`)

---

## Inbound webhooks `upcoming`

> 🚧 **Not yet available.** Inbound event webhooks are on the roadmap and **not implemented in production yet**. The dashboard configuration page is gated behind a "coming soon" state, and the semantic events, signature convention, and retry schedule documented below describe the **planned** design so you can prepare your integration — they are not live.
>
> What exists today is an internal, generic on-chain delivery: a single `stellar.tx` event carrying raw Stellar operation data, posted once (no retry/backoff) with an `X-Pollar-Signature: sha256=<hmac>` header. The structured `wallet.*` / `payment.*` events below are not emitted yet.

When available, you'll configure a webhook URL in **Build → Webhooks**. Pollar sends a `POST` request to your URL when an event occurs.

### Authentication

Every request includes an `X-Pollar-Signature` header — an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the raw request body using your webhook secret.

```typescript
import { createHmac } from 'crypto';

function verifyWebhook(payload: string, signature: string, secret: string): boolean {
  const expected = createHmac('sha256', secret)
    .update(payload)
    .digest('hex');
  return `sha256=${expected}` === signature;
}

// Next.js API route
export async function POST(req: NextRequest) {
  const payload = await req.text();
  const signature = req.headers.get('x-pollar-signature') ?? '';

  if (!verifyWebhook(payload, signature, process.env.POLLAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET!)) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Invalid signature' }, { status: 401 });
  }

  const event = JSON.parse(payload);
  // handle event...
  return NextResponse.json({ received: true });
}
```

Always respond with `200` as quickly as possible. If your endpoint returns a non-2xx status or times out, Pollar retries with exponential backoff.

### Retry policy `upcoming`

> Planned design — there is **no retry/backoff implemented today**. The current internal delivery posts once and logs failures.

| Attempt | Delay      |
| ------- | ---------- |
| 1       | Immediate  |
| 2       | 1 minute   |
| 3       | 10 minutes |
| 4       | 1 hour     |
| 5       | 24 hours   |

After 5 failed attempts the event is marked as failed and visible in **Build → Webhooks → Event log**.

## Outbound webhooks

Your backend calls Pollar to trigger actions. Currently:

- `POST /v1/wallets/activate` — see [Server API](https://docs.pollar.xyz/docs/sdk-reference/server-api)
